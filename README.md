Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in JavaScript using the HTML5 <canvas> element for rendering. It allows you to control a snake with arrow keys or on-screen buttons to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake itself.
How to Play

    Controls:
        Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
        On mobile devices, you can also control the snake's direction using on-screen buttons.

    Objective: Eat the red food squares to increase your score. Each food square eaten adds 10 points to your score. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

    Restart: You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.

Features

    Responsive design: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

    Score tracking: Your current score is displayed at the top of the game screen.

    Game over screen: When the game ends, a game over screen is displayed with your final score, and you can choose to restart the game.
